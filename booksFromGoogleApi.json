This book provides practical methods for encrypting messages, an interesting and entertaining historical perspective, and an incredible collection of ciphers and codes—including 30 unbreakable methods. In Secret Key Cryptography: Ciphers, from simple to unbreakable you will: Measure the strength of your ciphers and learn how to guarantee their security Construct and incorporate data-compression codes Generate true random numbers in bulk Construct huge primes and safe primes Add an undetectable backdoor to a cipher Defeat hypothetical ultracomputers that could be developed decades from now Construct 30 unbreakable ciphers Secret Key Cryptography gives you a toolbox of cryptographic techniques and Secret Key methods. The book’s simple, non-technical language is easy to understand and accessible for any reader, even without the advanced mathematics normally required for cryptography. You’ll learn how to create and solve ciphers, as well as how to measure their strength. As you go, you’ll explore both historic ciphers and groundbreaking new approaches—including a never-before-seen way to implement the uncrackable One-Time Pad algorithm. Whoever you are, this book is for you! History buffs will love seeing the evolution of sophisticated cryptographic methods, hobbyists will get a gentle introduction to cryptography, and engineers and computer scientists will learn the principles of constructing secure ciphers. Even professional cryptographers will find a range of new methods and concepts never published before. About the technology From the Roman empire’s Caesar cipher to the WWII Enigma machine, secret messages have influenced the course of history. Today, Secret Key cryptography is the backbone of all modern computing infrastructure. Properly designed, these algorithms are efficient and practical. Some are actually unbreakable, even using supercomputers or quantum technology! About the book Secret Key Cryptography teaches you how to create Secret Key ciphers, ranging from simple pen-and-paper methods to advanced techniques used in modern computer-based cryptography. It reveals both historic examples and current innovations. You’ll learn how to efficiently encrypt large files with fast stream ciphers, discover alternatives to AES encryption, and avoid strong-looking but weak ciphers. Simple language and fun-to-solve mini-ciphers make learning serious concepts easy and engaging. What's inside Construct 30 unbreakable ciphers Measure the strength of your ciphers and guarantee their security Add an undetectable backdoor to a cipher Defeat hypothetical ultracomputers of the future About the reader For professional engineers, computer scientists, and cryptography hobbyists. No advanced math knowledge is required. About the author Frank Rubin has been doing cryptography for over 50 years. He holds an MS in Mathematics, and a PhD in Computer Science.

See in Key is a revolutionary new book for musicians and producers who don’t want to stop making music to search for Scales and Chord information. Just pick one of the twelve ‘Key Pages’ and you will be presented with the notes of many scales and chords for that key, and be able to see how the scales are related to each other. This is a very visual based theory book, designed to help you understand concepts by seeing patterns rather than through lengthy explanations. As well as the 12 Key pages, there are 12 chord pages, a basic introduction to music theory and other charts you will find useful for writing music. Don't stop making music to learn new scales and theory, use See in Key to find what you need and keep moving forward.",

It is likely to be a text that my students will return to throughout their degree.\" - Dr Karen Parkhill, Bangor University \"The editors have done a fantastic job. This second edition is really accessible to the student and provides the key literature in the key geographical terms of scale, space, time, place and landscape.\" - Dr Elias Symeonakis, Manchester Metropolitan University \"An excellent introductory text for accessible overviews of key concepts across human and physical geography.\" - Professor Patrick Devine-Wright, Exeter University Including ten new chapters on nature, globalization, development and risk, and a new section on practicing geography, this is a completely revised and updated edition of the best-selling, standard student resource. Key Concepts in Geography explains the key terms - space, time, place, scale, landscape - that define the language of geography. It is unique in the reference literature as it provides in one volume concepts from both human geography and physical geography. Four introductory chapters on different intellectual traditions in geography situate and introduce the entries on the key concepts. Each entry then comprises a short definition, a summary of the principal arguments, a substantive 5,000-word discussion, the use of real-life examples, and annotated notes for further reading. Written in an accessible way by established figures in the discipline, the definitions provide thorough explanations of all the core concepts that undergraduates of geography must understand to complete their degree.",

When she disappears, only Tash holds the key that might bring her back. Tash didn’t want to go to camp, didn’t want to spend the summer with a bunch of strangers, didn’t want to be separated from the only two people she has ever been able to count on: her uncle Kevin, who saved her from foster care, and Cap’n Jackie, who lives next door. Camp turns out to be pretty fun, actually, but when Tash returns home, Cap’n Jackie is gone. And Tash needs her — the made-up stories of dolphin-dragons, the warm cookies that made everything all right after a fight, the key Cap’n Jackie always insisted had magic in it. The Captain always said all Tash had to do was hold it tight and the magic would come. Was it true? Could the key bring Cap’n Jackie back? In a heartfelt and stunningly written story, Pat Schmatz introduces readers to a tenacious, fiercely loyal girl struggling to let go of the fantasies and fears of her childhood . . . and say yes to everything that lies ahead.",
